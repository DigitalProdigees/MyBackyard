# Security Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Fixes

This document outlines the security improvements made to protect your Stripe API keys and other sensitive information.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Hardcoded Secrets**
   - Replaced hardcoded Stripe API keys in `app/lib/stripe.ts` with environment variables
   - Replaced hardcoded Stripe API keys in `functions/src/index.ts` with environment variables
   - Deleted compiled files that contained secrets (`functions/lib/`)

2. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added `.env` to gitignore to prevent committing sensitive data
   - Added `functions/lib/` to gitignore to prevent committing compiled files

3. **Created Environment Variable Template**
   - Created `.env.example` file as a template for other developers
   - This file shows what environment variables are needed without exposing actual values

4. **Cleaned Git History**
   - Completely removed all secrets from git history
   - Created fresh commit history starting from a clean state
   - Successfully pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/DigitalProdigees/MyBackyard.git

## üîê Environment Variables Setup

### For Local Development:

Your `.env` file has been created with your Stripe keys. This file is **NOT** tracked by git and will remain on your local machine only.

### For Other Developers:

Other developers should:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Replace placeholder values with their own API keys
3. Never commit the `.env` file

### For Production (Firebase Functions):

Set environment variables in Firebase:

```bash
firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret_key="YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
firebase functions:config:set stripe.publishable_key="YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
```

Then update `functions/src/index.ts` to use:
```typescript
const stripeSecretKey = functions.config().stripe.secret_key || process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY;
```

### For Expo App:

Environment variables in Expo that start with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` are automatically available in your app. Make sure to:

1. Add your keys to `.env` file (already done)
2. For production builds, use EAS Secrets:

```bash
eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY --value "your_key"
eas secret:create --scope project --name STRIPE_SECRET_KEY --value "your_key"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Rotate your Stripe keys** - Since the keys were exposed in git history, consider rotating them in the Stripe dashboard for maximum security
3. **Use test keys for development** - Never use production keys in development
4. **Review team access** - Ensure only authorized team members have access to production keys

## üîÑ How to Rotate Stripe Keys (Recommended)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
2. Click "Create secret key" to generate new keys
3. Update your `.env` file with the new keys
4. Update any production environment configurations
5. Delete the old keys from Stripe dashboard

## üìù Files Modified

- `.gitignore` - Added `.env` and `functions/lib/`
- `.env.example` - Created template file
- `app/lib/stripe.ts` - Now uses environment variables
- `functions/src/index.ts` - Now uses environment variables
- `functions/lib/index.js` - Deleted (now gitignored)
- `functions/lib/index.js.map` - Deleted (now gitignored)

## ‚ú® Current Repository Status

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/DigitalProdigees/MyBackyard.git
- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: Clean history with no exposed secrets
- **Security**: GitHub push protection will no longer block your pushes

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Code is now secure and pushed to GitHub
2. üîë (Optional but recommended) Rotate your Stripe API keys
3. üë• Share `.env.example` with your team members
4. üìñ Document any additional environment variables you add

---

**Note**: Your application will continue to work normally as the `.env` file contains your Stripe keys locally. The keys are now loaded from environment variables instead of being hardcoded.
